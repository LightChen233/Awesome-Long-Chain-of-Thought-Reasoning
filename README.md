# üåü Introduction

Welcome to the repository associated with our survey paper, "Towards Reasoning Era: A Survey of Long Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning Large Language Models". This repository contains **resources and updates** related to our ongoing Long CoT research. For a detailed introduction, please refer to [our survey paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09567).

Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems.

However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "test-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT.
1. We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms.
2. Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT.
3. We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice.
4. Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. 

By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.

### 2.1 Deep Reasoning

The core of deep reasoning ability lies in the need for sufficient logical depth to manage a large number of reasoning nodes. Without this capability, the performance of reasoning large language models (RLLMs) significantly degrades. Current methods for enhancing deep reasoning can be categorized into two main approaches: Deep Reasoning Format and Deep Reasoning Learning.

<img src="./assets/images/deep-reasoning-2.png" style="width: 580pt">

#### 2.1.1 Deep Reasoning Format
Since reasoning models heavily depend on the format of reasoning, they tend to achieve the deepest reasoning paths in the forms they excel at. As a result, some works have begun exploring better reasoning formats for deeper reasoning.

The deficiency of deep reasoning abilities in RLLMs can significantly reduce model performance. As a result, the academic focus has shifted towards enhancing reasoning capabilities through training. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT), as a memory process, can stabilize model output, while reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates generalization and self-learning.

### 2.2 Feasible Reflection

#### 2.2.1 Feedback

Feedback mechanisms provide multi-granularity evaluation signals for Long CoT, ranging from Overall Feedback, which evaluates the final outcome, to Process Feedback, which supervises individual steps of the reasoning process, and Hybrid Feedback, which combines both types. These mechanisms not only support reward modeling and path optimization but also lay the foundation for subsequent self-correction, serving as a crucial bridge to move RLLMs from static generation to dynamic evaluation.

### 2.3 Extensive Exploration
Extensive Exploration enables reasoning large language models (RLLMs) to explore multiple reasoning paths more deeply and comprehensively when dealing with complex problems, thereby improving problem-solving accuracy and robustness. From the perspective of exploration types, extensive exploration techniques can be divided into three categories: Exploration Scaling, Internal Exploration, and External Exploration.

#### 2.3.1 Exploration Scaling
Exploration Scaling aims to enhance the model's ability to solve more complex problems by increasing the number or length of reasoning paths. This approach is typically suitable when the reasoning task is more complex, and a single reasoning path may not effectively lead to the correct answer.

---

**Sequential Scaling**

- **Core Idea:** By extending the reasoning chain of a single path, the model gradually deepens its thinking, thereby improving its understanding and handling of complex problems. This is especially applicable to tasks with Long CoT that require multi-step reasoning to draw conclusions, such as mathematical proofs, logical deductions, and multi-step planning.
- **Representative Works:**
  - [OpenAI-o1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16720) / [Deepseek-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948): 
  Extends the reasoning chain to provide detailed multi-step reasoning processes, effectively improving the ability to solve complex problems in mathematics, coding, and other areas.
  - [ITT(Inner Thinking Transformer:)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13842): redefines the layer computation in Transformer as "thinking steps," dynamically allocating computation resources to deeper reasoning on key tokens without increasing the total number of model parameters.

---

**Parallel Scaling**

- **Core Idea:** By generating multiple reasoning paths in parallel and combining, voting, or verifying their results, the model can effectively avoid the issue of a single path getting trapped in local optima or errors, thus improving robustness and accuracy in situations with high ambiguity, multiple possible solutions, or unclear outcomes.
- **Representative Works:**
  - [Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171): Proposes generating multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most frequent answer from the results, effectively improving the stability and accuracy of the final answer.
  - [ECM(Electronic Circuit Model)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03325): Borrowing the concepts of parallel and series circuits in electronics, combines reasoning paths in parallel or series, considering various possibilities and improving decision quality.

---

#### 2.3.2 Internal Exploration
Internal Exploration primarily refers to large reasoning models (RLLMs) actively exploring and optimizing reasoning paths through their internal mechanisms (usually reinforcement learning strategies and reward mechanisms), allowing for more efficient and deeper solutions to complex reasoning problems. This method enables the model to autonomously adjust its reasoning strategy, reducing reliance on external guiding data.

---

**RL Strategies**
- **Core Idea:** Leverage reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to guide models in actively learning and exploring diverse reasoning paths. This approach overcomes the limitations of overly uniform patterns in reasoning processes, enhancing model performance in tasks that involve high uncertainty or heavily depend on autonomous decision-making.
- **Representative Works:**
  - [PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347): A classic RL algorithm that efficiently optimizes a model's internal decision-making mechanism through a policy-gradient-based approach, suitable for path exploration and optimization in complex environments.
  - [DivPO(Diverse Preference Optimization)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18101): Encourages models to explore a greater variety of reasoning paths to maintain decision diversity, preventing convergence to local optima.
  - [GRPO(Guided Reward Policy Optimization)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300): Designs a guided reward mechanism that enables models to more effectively explore within complex logical reasoning spaces.

---

**Reward Strategies**

- **Core Idea:** Directly guide models to explore and optimize effective reasoning paths through carefully designed reward functions, which are particularly useful in scenarios where there are explicit optimization goals or specific reasoning bottlenecks to address.
- **Representative Works:**
  - [Deepseek-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948): Proposes a specially designed reward function to incentivize models to optimize intermediate reasoning steps, aiding the model in building a high-quality internal reasoning process.
  - [ReST-MCTS*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03816): Combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with reward strategies, guiding the tree search algorithm through process rewards for more accurate exploration of effective reasoning paths, improving overall reasoning quality.

---

#### 2.3.3 External Exploration
External exploration refers to the assistance of external tools, human knowledge, or other models in guiding the model to more effectively explore diverse reasoning paths and improve its ability to solve complex problems. This approach is often used in scenarios where fine-grained guidance or external knowledge is essential for effective problem-solving. External exploration can be subdivided into two types: Human-driven Exploration and Model-driven Exploration.

---

**Human-driven Exploration**
- **Core Idea:** Utilizes human intuition, experience, or feedback to guide the model in selecting and adjusting reasoning paths, especially in situations where the model's autonomous exploration ability is limited or the reasoning task is complex and requires decomposition into multiple sub-tasks.
- **Representative Works:**
  - [Least-to-Most](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10625): Breaks down complex problems into simpler subproblems, solving each and using prior answers as inputs for subsequent steps, ultimately synthesizing a solution for the overall problem. This method was proposed to address the "difficulty generalization" bottleneck in traditional Chain-of-Thought approaches.
  - [ToT (Tree-of-Thought)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601): Expands the traditional "left-to-right" token generation reasoning process into a "tree structure exploration," where each node represents a thought unit. This supports multi-path attempts, backtracking, forward reasoning, and self-evaluation within the reasoning process.

---

**Model-driven Exploration**

- **Core Idea:** Uses auxiliary models or algorithms to automatically guide the current model's reasoning process, reducing the need for human intervention and allowing for the efficient search and optimization of numerous complex reasoning paths, thus improving automation and overall efficiency.
- **Representative Works:**
  - [PPO-MCTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15028): Integrates MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) with PPO-based training to enhance reasoning. The key is to retain the value network obtained during PPO training and use it during the reasoning phase to guide the MCTS in selecting more desirable output sequences, thereby improving the quality and consistency of the generated text.
  - [MindStar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16265):  Reformulates complex reasoning problems (particularly mathematical ones) as search problems, where structured searches are performed over different reasoning paths to select the optimal one.
  - [rStar-Math](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04519):  Develops a strong mathematical reasoning system through MCTS + small model reward mechanisms + self-evolution processes, enabling small models to outperform o1-preview in mathematical capabilities.

## 3. Key Phenomena and Related Principles

<img src="./assets/images/analysis.jpg" style="width: 580pt">

### 3.1 Reasoning Emergence Phenomenon

Long CoT abilities naturally emerge after training, demonstrated by the model's ability to generate multi-step, coherent reasoning processes by internalizing logical structures and contextual examples from pretraining data, even in the absence of direct supervision. Related studies have described this phenomenon as follows:

- [Wang et al.](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.153/) found that a small number of high-quality contextual examples can effectively guide RL-based language models (RLLMs) to generate clear, logically consistent reasoning chains, indicating that the model has internalized basic reasoning patterns during pretraining.
- [Madaan et al.](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.0/) demonstrated that even without specific problem entities, the model can still generate reasonable reasoning chains by retaining only the logical structure information, showcasing its inductive and transfer abilities regarding structural information.
- [Stechly et al.](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kPBEAZU5Nm) pointed out that by adjusting decoding strategies or constructing specialized prompts, latent  CoT abilities within the model can be explicitly activated, resulting in multi-step reasoning in complex tasks.
- [Guo et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948) showed that rule-based RL strategies can directly induce models to form coherent reasoning chains during pretraining, significantly improving performance in multi-step tasks.

### 3.2 Reasoning Boundary Phenomenon

Large language models exhibit clear performance boundaries in Long CoT: when the depth or complexity of reasoning exceeds a certain threshold, model performance significantly degrades, sometimes even resulting in logical collapse. This phenomenon suggests that current models have a "reasoning boundary," which is the upper limit of reasoning complexity that can be supported by their parameter space and computational resources. Existing research has systematically explored this phenomenon from both theoretical modeling and empirical analysis:

- [Chen et al.](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pC44UMwy2v.) formally introduced the "reasoning boundary" concept, experimentally quantifying the performance critical points of models under different task complexities, and indicating that accuracy sharply declines when the reasoning task exceeds the model's capacity.
- [Bi et al.](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29721) observed that performance deteriorates drastically when the model attempts to mimic overly complex CoT examples in code generation tasks, indicating that beyond a certain complexity, Long CoT examples become counterproductive.
- [Feng et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15408) proposed a mathematical model showing that models with fixed parameter sizes cannot perform numerical calculations exceeding a certain complexity, revealing a hard limit in accuracy.
- [Zhou et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05252) constructed the GSM-Infinite dataset and demonstrated through experiments that the upper limits of reasoning abilities vary significantly across different tasks, further emphasizing that reasoning boundaries are related to task structure.

### 3.3 Overthinking Phenomenon

In Long CoT, extending the reasoning chain does not always lead to performance improvement. Studies have shown that once the reasoning length exceeds the model‚Äôs capacity, accuracy decreases, a phenomenon known as "overthinking," which reflects the non-linear marginal benefits of reasoning and error accumulation in the process.

- [Chen et al.](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pC44UMwy2v.) found that when the number of reasoning steps exceeds the model‚Äôs boundary, reasoning accuracy significantly drops, indicating that there is an optimal depth range for reasoning.
- [Wolf et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18028) emphasized that the fundamental reason for performance degradation is the amplification of errors in intermediate reasoning steps, which affects the final judgment.
- [Xie et al.](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14768v1) experimentally showed that reasoning length does not have a monotonic relationship with accuracy, challenging the intuition that "longer CoT leads to better reasoning."
- [Wu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07266) established a mathematical model defining the "optimal reasoning length" interval under different models and task conditions, suggesting that performance reverses once the length exceeds the optimal range.
- [Chen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03325) introduced the "reasoning chain Ohm‚Äôs law," analogizing the non-linear relationship between reasoning length and performance to information flow resistance in the model.

### 3.4 Inference Test-Time Scaling Phenomenon

The inference test-time scaling phenomenon refers to the increase in reasoning performance by extending the computational process (e.g., reasoning chain length or sample number) during inference. This phenomenon reveals the "dynamic amplification" potential of the model, but also comes with a trade-off between exploration depth and computational cost.

- [Brown et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787) observed that by repeating multiple rounds of inference attempts, even if the initial attempt fails, the correct answer can be found within a certain number of trials, introducing the "language monkey" phenomenon.
- [o1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16720) demonstrated that simply increasing the reasoning chain length improves accuracy, particularly in complex mathematical tasks.
- [Jin et al.](https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2024.findings-acl/) pointed out that while increasing the reasoning chain length initially leads to performance improvement, beyond a certain threshold, performance deteriorates, resulting in a typical nonlinear growth curve.
- [Wu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00724) found that there is a logarithmic relationship between the number of inference samples and the lower bound of error, suggesting an asymptotic relationship between computational complexity (FLOPs) and inference performance.
- [Chen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03325) established the theoretical upper-bound of parallel inference, indicating that no matter how the sample size is increased, the model‚Äôs verification performance cannot exceed its internal reasoning ceiling.

### 3.5 PRM and ORM Selction Phenomenon

In reinforcement learning optimization, Long CoT tasks involve supervision of the model generation process. Researchers distinguish between two main strategies: Process Reward Model (PRM), which focuses on the reasoning process itself, and Outcome Reward Model (ORM), which only concerns whether the final output is correct. The two strategies differ significantly in terms of generalization ability, learning stability, and supervision cost.

- [Lampinen et al.](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.38) validated the causal relationship between intermediate steps and final answers in qualitative experiments, providing theoretical support for the rationale behind process supervision.
- [Jia et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10581) theoretically proved that under sufficiently diverse data, ORM is not harder to optimize than PRM, with the two only differing by polynomial factors in terms of sample complexity.
- [Guo et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948) showed that rule-based PRM reinforcement learning significantly improves the model's Long CoT capabilities in complex tasks but also faces the risk of reward hacking.
- [Tan](https://aclanthology.org/2023.blackboxnlp-1.12.) emphasized the importance of reward distribution in intermediate reasoning steps for complex reasoning paths, which ORM cannot provide.
- [Jiang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03124) pointed out that PRM is more costly in terms of data collection, as it requires labeling each reasoning step, limiting its large-scale application.

### 3.6 Aha Moment Phenomenon

The Aha Moment refers to the sudden integration of information during the reasoning process, leading to a key turning point in judgment, resembling human reflection and self-correction. This phenomenon highlights the model's dynamic cognitive adjustment abilities, but its occurrence depends on the collaboration between external stimuli and internal mechanisms.

- [Guo et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948) first triggered the Aha Moment behavior under unsupervised conditions through rule-based rewards, with models reflecting on intermediate reasoning and self-correcting.
- [Xie et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14768) further demonstrated through experiments that this behavior can be replicated across multiple models, verifying that it is not anÂÅ∂ÁÑ∂ event but rather an inducible strategy.
- [Zhou et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05132) extended the Aha Moment phenomenon to multimodal tasks, showing that it is not specific to text-based tasks but reflects the model's broader cognitive abilities.
- [Liu et al.](https://oatllm.notion.site/oat-zero) pointed out that in certain reinforcement learning frameworks (e.g., R1-Zero), Aha behavior may not genuinely exist, with lengthening the generation more likely a result of reward optimization rather than actual reflection.
- [Yang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02956) found that the Aha behavior often involves human-like language enhancement and dynamic uncertainty regulation, with the model more inclined to use expressions like "I think" under high-pressure tasks, reflecting its coping mechanisms for task stress.




## 4. Algorithms

### 4.1 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

In advancing large models to possess powerful Long CoT reasoning abilities, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a crucial role, bridging pre-training with more advanced alignment methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The core goal of SFT is to teach models how to follow instructions and initially master the ability to generate structured, step-by-step reasoning chains, thus laying the foundation for more complex reasoning tasks.



- **In the context of deep reasoning, SFT is especially critical.**
Although the lack of sufficient reasoning depth in RLLMs significantly reduces performance, SFT stabilizes the model‚Äôs output format through a memorization process, allowing it to learn reasoning from human-labeled or distilled data. In contrast to reinforcement learning (RL), which focuses more on generalization and self-learning, SFT plays a vital role in deep reasoning imitation. It allows RLLMs to learn complex reasoning patterns by mimicking high-quality reasoning examples generated by humans, advanced RLLMs, or enhanced RLLMs, and generalizing them to new tasks. SFT not only significantly improves the model‚Äôs reasoning performance but, in some cases, enables even a small number of high-quality samples to activate the underlying LLM's deep reasoning capabilities, allowing it to predict events outside the model's knowledge base. This makes SFT one of the key technologies for enhancing reasoning levels and generalization abilities in RLLMs.

- **For feasible reflection, SFT primarily focuses on optimization-based imitation (Refinement Imitation).**
In reflection-based LLM reasoning, SFT is a key mechanism for enabling self-optimization and error correction in the model. Through SFT, the model can directly learn the error-correction processes of advanced LLMs, significantly enhancing its reflective abilities, such as performing self-play reasoning, iterative feedback error correction, and even justifying and reflecting on the reasoning process through incremental natural language feedback. Additionally, SFT can integrate visual and textual reasoning in multimodal scenarios, improving the model‚Äôs critical thinking and self-correction abilities. SFT enhances the reasoning accuracy of LLMs through iterative feedback and self-correction strategies, which is especially beneficial for smaller models.


#### 4.1.1 Core Technology

SFT consists of two core concepts: **Instruction Tuning** and **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, PEFT**„ÄÇ

**Instruction Tuning**
-   **Core Idea:** By fine-tuning the model on a large number of instructions covering various tasks, the model‚Äôs zero-shot generalization ability on unseen tasks can be significantly enhanced. This enables the model to learn the skill of "following instructions."
-   **Representative Works:**
    -   [Finetuned Language Models Are Zero-Shot Learners (FLAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01652): Google‚Äôs pioneering work demonstrating that multi-task instruction fine-tuning unlocks zero-shot capabilities in LLMs for unseen tasks.
    -   [Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10792): A comprehensive survey systematically introducing methods, datasets, challenges, and future directions in instruction tuning.



**ÂèÇÊï∞È´òÊïàÂæÆË∞É(PEFT)**

- **Core Idea:** Given the high cost of full fine-tuning (Full Fine-tuning) for LLMs, PEFT methods have emerged. These methods achieve near-full fine-tuning effects by updating only a small subset of the model‚Äôs parameters, greatly reducing hardware requirements.
-   **Representative Works:**
    -   [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685): A revolutionary LoRA technique proposed to efficiently fine-tune models by injecting low-rank adaptation matrices, currently one of the most widely used PEFT methods.
    -   [QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314): A further optimization of LoRA, combining 4-bit quantization, double-weight quantization, and page optimizers, making it possible to fine-tune massive models on a single consumer-grade GPU.
    -   [Adapter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00751): Inserts small neural network modules (adapters) between layers of the Transformer, updating only the parameters of these adapters during training.
    -   [Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08691) / [P-Tuning](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-short.8/): Instead of modifying the model‚Äôs weights, it learns one or more trainable virtual tokens (soft prompts) at the input end, guiding the model to perform downstream tasks more effectively.

#### 4.1.4 Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

1.  **Data Quality is Far More Important than Quantity:**
    -   **Core Principle**: It is better to use 1,000 high-quality, diverse data points than 10,000 low-quality, homogeneous ones. Low-quality data can teach the model incorrect patterns.
    -   **Format Consistency**: Ensure that all training data follows a unified dialogue template (e.g.,[ChatML](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating)), which is crucial for training the model to recognize roles and dialogue boundaries.
2.  **Choose the Right Fine-Tuning Strategy**:
    -   For most applications with limited resources, **QLoRA** should be prioritized as it strikes the best balance between efficiency and effectiveness.
    -   If seeking optimal performance and with sufficient resources, **full fine-tuning** may be considered, though care should be taken to avoid the risk of overfitting.
3.  **Tuning Key Hyperparameters**:
    -   **Learning Rate**: SFT typically uses smaller learning rates than pretraining, usually ranging from `1e-5` to `5e-5`.
    -   **Epochs**: Usually, 1 to 3 epochs are sufficient. Too many epochs can lead to overfitting on small datasets, causing the model to "forget" the general knowledge learned during pretraining.
    -   **Batch Size**: Within the memory limits, increasing the batch size appropriately helps stabilize training.
4.  **Evaluation and Iteration**:
    -   **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Do not rely solely on the loss function. Combine it with **objective evaluation** benchmarks (such as MMLU) and subjective **human evaluation** for a more thorough assessment of model performance.
    -   **Iterative Optimization**: SFT is an ongoing iterative process. Based on evaluation results, continuously clean the data, adjust hyperparameters, and optimize the model.

### 4.3 Agent

The ability of LLM Agents to solve complex problems fundamentally relies on their reasoning and planning capabilities. The core mechanism of this ability is Long CoT, which breaks down complex tasks into smaller, logical steps. The characteristics of Long CoT, particularly its depth of inference, extensive exploration, and feasibility reflection, are not just additional features but the foundation for realizing these abilities. If an agent cannot "think longer" and engage in a "thinking-critique-improvement" cycle, its ability to make independent decisions and adapt in unfamiliar scenarios will be severely limited, causing it to revert to "predefined pipelines" or "iterative interactions with humans." Models such as o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have made breakthroughs in using Long CoT to solve complex tasks, directly proving this causal relationship: enhanced reasoning depth directly leads to an improvement in agent capabilities (autonomy in complex tasks). Therefore, the future development of AI agents will be closely linked to breakthroughs in Long CoT.

Based on their construction methods, we classify the datasets into four major categories: Manual Annotation, Direct Distillation, Search-based Distillation, and Validated Distillation.

In this section, we systematically list representative datasets under each category, covering key information such as their sources, modalities, applicable domains, and data scale, providing researchers and developers seeking suitable training resources with a comprehensive guide and convenient reference.

#### 5.2.1 Manual Annotation

These datasets are created through manual annotation or rule-based construction, typically offering high-quality samples with interpretable reasoning paths. While smaller in scale, they are critical for guiding the alignment and evaluation of initial models.
